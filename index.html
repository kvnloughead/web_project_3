          Need more action and adventure in your life instead of the same old 
          routine? From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take 
          you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your country. 
          Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where 
          it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a 
          total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying 
          and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire 
          to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author 
          Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.

            <p class="place__text">Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary
             and highly underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state 
             you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared 
             for an arduous trek.</p>
           <p class="place__text">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first 
             European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. 
             Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 
             3-month expedition.</p>
           <p class="place__text">Average cost: $80-100.</p>

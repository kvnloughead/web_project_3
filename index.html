          That's exactly what we have arranged for you via this travel story</p>
        <p class="intro__text">
          Need more action and adventure in your life instead of the same old 
          routine? From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take 
          you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your country. 
          Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where 
          it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a 
          total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying 
          and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire 
          to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author 
          Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.

          <div class="place__description">
            <p class="place__text">Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary
             and highly underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state 
             you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared 
             for an arduous trek.</p>
           <p class="place__text">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first 
             European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. 
             Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 
             3-month expedition.</p>
           <p class="place__text">Average cost: $80-100.</p>

            <p class="place__text">There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in 
              springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this 
              state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it 
              while it lasts.</p>
           <p class="place__text">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make
              sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe 
              company in the history of the world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the 
              Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof 
              boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be 
              confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also better
              than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>

            <p class="place__text">Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has 
              several other reasons for going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, 
              “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home to the world-famous 
              General Electric Company.</p>
           <p class="place__text">This is where modern power generators were born as well as 
              contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this would be the perfect 
              place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through 
              those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back 
              about $10-20.</p>

            <p class="place__text">Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
              although it can be from time to time, is another town worth passing through for several 
              different reasons. While it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg 
              address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a 
              rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
           <p class="place__text">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already 
             guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a 
             Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark 
             on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife 
             Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>
           <p class="place__text">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

            <p class="place__text">From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of 
              Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this 
              particular region of North America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude 
              of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this 
              centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks 
              is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most 
              thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved 
              break to ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!</p>
           <p class="place__text">The cost of a daily ticket: about $100.</p>
